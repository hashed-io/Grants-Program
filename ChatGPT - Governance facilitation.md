## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If you've participated in decentralized governance, you know keeping the community engaged and informed can be challenging. The amount of information and context that goes into each proposal is difficult to digest, long conversations occur in many places, and people have busy lives. The governance rules can themselves be complex and easy to forget. 

This ChatGPT integration aims to improve governance, participation, and engagement in Polkadot and serve as a POC to improve decentralized governance participation by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT to summarize proposals and contextual information like proposals from the same account, voting status, and information on how to participate. In addition, future applications could be summarized Element conversations, sentiment analysis, reminders, and social media posts that keep DOT holders engaged and informed about governance.

### Project Details
ChatGPT will be an open-source integration that leverages the ChatGPT API to provide the following features:

#### 1. Summarizing and Simplifying Proposals
- Monitor and summarize proposals
- Make complex information easily understandable
- Support multilingual translations for global collaboration

#### 2. Summarizing and Simplifying Conversations
- Monitor and summarize element or polkassembly conversations
- Help users catch up with what's going on rapidly
- Support multilingual translations for global collaboration

#### 3. Providing Additional Context

- Top voter active proposals, controvertial proposals and time left to vote

#### 4. Onboarding and Support for Newcomers
- Assist with the onboarding process for new members, explaining Gov 2 and how they can participate
- Answer frequently asked questions
- Provide basic support and resources

#### 5. Voting Reminders
- Remind participants to vote on proposals and decisions

### Ecosystem Fit
Gavin Wood and the Polkadot community spend a lot of time improving, designing and building decentralized governance. It's one of the key value-propositions from the Polkadot ecocystem. This proposals aims to contirnute in that direction by facilitating informed participation.

DAOs and other digital native organizations with decentralized governance have the same need to improve informed engagement as well as on demand onboarding, training and tools to improve participation.
