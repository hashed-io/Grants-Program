## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If you've participated in decentralized governance, you know keeping the community engaged and informed can be challenging. The amount of information and context that goes into each proposal is difficult to digest, long conversations occur in many places, and people have busy lives. The governance rules can themselves be complex and easy to forget. Having a personal assistant that summarizes, provides context, and reminds us about the governance details would be great.

This ChatGPT integration aims to improve governance, participation, and engagement in Polkadot and serve as a POC to improve decentralized governance participation by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT to summarize proposals and contextual information like proposals from the same account, voting status, and information on how to participate. In addition, future applications could be summarized Discord conversations, sentiment analysis, reminders, and social media posts that keep DOT holders engaged and informed about governance.

### Project Details
ChatGPT-DAO will be an open-source integration that leverages the ChatGPT API to provide the following features:

#### 1. Summarizing and Simplifying Conversations
